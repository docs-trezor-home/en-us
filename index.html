            <h2>Securing Your Trezor Wallet</h2>
            <p>Your <a href="#">Trezor Wallet</a> is where you store your private keys and manage your cryptocurrencies. Security is paramount, and Trezor offers multiple layers of protection, including PIN codes, passphrases, and firmware updates. Always ensure your device is running the latest firmware and never share your recovery seed with anyone.</p>
            <p>For added security, consider setting up a hidden wallet within the Trezor Suite. This feature allows you to create a secondary wallet that can only be accessed with a unique passphrase, offering an additional layer of protection for your assets.</p>
